################################################################################
                        1. WHAT IS MADANALYSIS 5 ?
################################################################################

MadAnalysis 5 is a new framework for phenomenological investigations at particle
colliders. Based on a C++ kernel, this program allows to efficiently perform, in
a straightforward and user-friendly fashion, sophisticated physics analyses of
event files such as those generated by a large class of Monte Carlo event
generators.

The first running mode of the program, easier to handle, uses the strengths of a
powerful Python interface in order to implement physics analyses by means of a
set of intuitive commands.

The second running modes requires to implement the analyses in the C++
programming language, directly within the core of the analysis framework. This
opens unlimited possibilities concerning the level of complexity that can be
reached, the latter being only limited by the programming skills and the
originality of the user.

More details can be found on the MadAnalysis 5 website:

################################################################################
                             2. REQUIREMENTS
################################################################################

MadAnalysis 5 requires several external libraries in order to properly run:

 - Python 2.6 or a more recent version (but not the 3.X series) that can be
   downloaded from the website
     http://www.python.org/
   In order to check the installed version of Python on a system, it is
   sufficient to issue in a shell 
     python --version

 - The GNU GCC compiler. MadAnalysis 5 has been validated with the versions
   4.3.X and 4.4.X. The GCC compiler can be downloaded from the website:
     http://gcc.gnu.org/
     
 - ROOT v5.27 or a more recent version that can be downloaded from the website
     http://root.cern.ch/
   To check the version number of ROOT installed on a system, it is sufficient
   to type in a shell release 
     root-config --version
   Moreover, the Python libraries generated by ROOT must be present. To install
   them, it is necessary to first install the Linux package 'Python-devel' on
   the system. Next, before generating the ROOT makefile, the ROOT configuration
   script has to be run as 
     ./configure --with-python
   Let us note that the Python release employed when starting MadAnalysis 5 has
   to be the same that has been used for the compilation of ROOT. 

To benefit from all options coming with the MadAnalysis 5 program, the following
(optional) libraries have to be installed on the system:
 - Zlib headers and libraries that can be downloaded from the website
     http://zlib.net/
 - The FastJet package version 3.0, or a more recent version, that can be
   downloaded from
     http://fastjet.fr/
   This package can also be installed by typing 'install fastjet' in MadAnalysis
   5.
 - latex and pdflatex compilers


################################################################################
            3. DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING THE MADANALYSIS 5 PACKAGE
################################################################################

The latest stable version of the MadAnalysis 5 package can be downloaded as a
tarball from the website
  https://launchpad.net/madanalysis5
The tarball can subsequently be unpacked by issuing in a shell
  tar -xvf ma5_xxxx.tgz
where 'xxxx' stands for a version number.

Alternatively, MadAnalysis 5 can also be obtained via the Bazaar versioning
system by issuing in a shell
  bzr branch lp:madanalysis5

################################################################################
                   5. VERY FIRST STEPS WITH MADANALYSIS 5
################################################################################

To start MadAnalysis 5, it is enough to type in a shell
  bin/ma5

In a first step, the program checks all the dependencies and provide warning
and/or error messages if necessary. Next, the SampleAnalyzer C++ kernel library
is generated. This is performed once and for all at the first run of MadAnalysis
5. Let us however note that if the system configuration changes, this is
detected by MadAnalysis 5 and the library is regenerated.

If everything is going as smoothly as it should, a Python command line interface
with a 'ma5>' prompt appears. To learn how to use MadAnalysis 5 and to get an
overview of its functionalities, we refer in particular to Section 3 of the
manual that can be found on the webpage
  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1599


################################################################################
                  6. TROUBLESHOOTINGS AND BUG REPORTS
################################################################################

Any public release of MadAnalysis 5 has been automatically and intensely
validated. However, especially due to the variety of possible system
configurations and the large number of functionalities included in the program,
it is not impossible that some bugs are found. In this case, is is strongly
suggested to create a report on our website
  https://launchpad.net/madanalysis5

In this way, you also participate to the improvement of MadAnalysis 5 and the
authors thank you for this.


################################################################################
                         7. OUR FAMOUS LAST WORDS
################################################################################

The development team of MadAnalysis 5 hopes that the package will meet the
expectations of the users and help particle physicists in their phenomenological
investigations.
