### What is MadAnalysis 5? 

MadAnalysis 5 is a framework for phenomenological investigations at particle
colliders. Based on a C++ kernel, this program allows to efficiently perform, in
a straightforward and user-friendly fashion, sophisticated physics analyses of
event files such as those generated by a large class of Monte Carlo event
generators.

The first running mode ([Normal Mode](https://madanalysis.irmp.ucl.ac.be/attachment/wiki/WikiStart/normal_mode_v1.8.pdf)) of the program, easier to handle, uses the strengths of a
powerful Python interface in order to implement physics analyses by means of a
set of intuitive commands.

The second running mode ([Expert Mode](http://madanalysis.irmp.ucl.ac.be/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/MadAnalysis_5_v1_6___Expert_Mode.pdf)) requires to implement the analyses in the C++
programming language, directly within the core of the analysis framework. This
opens unlimited possibilities concerning the level of complexity that can be
reached, the latter being only limited by the programming skills and the
originality of the user.

More details can be found on the [MadAnalysis 5 website](https://launchpad.net/madanalysis5).

### Requirements

MadAnalysis 5 requires several external libraries in order to properly run:

 - Python 3.6 or a more recent version that can be downloaded from [this website](http://www.python.org/)
   In order to check the installed version of Python on a system, it is
   sufficient to issue in a shell `$ python --version`.

 - The GNU GCC compiler. MadAnalysis 5 has been validated with the versions
   `4.3.X` and `4.4.X`. The GCC compiler can be downloaded from [this website](http://gcc.gnu.org/).

To benefit from all options coming with the MadAnalysis 5 program, the following
(optional) libraries have to be installed on the system:
 - Zlib headers and libraries that can be downloaded from [this website](http://zlib.net/) which can 
also be downloaded by by typing `ma5> install zlib` through MadAnalysis interface.
 - The FastJet package version 3.3, or a more recent version, that can be
   downloaded from [this link](http://fastjet.fr/). This package can also be installed by 
  typing `ma5> install fastjet` in MadAnalysis.
 - LaTeX and `pdflatex` compilers for report rendering.


### Downloading and installing the MadAnalysis 5 package

We are moving from our previous location in Launchpad but the latest MadAnalysis 5
version can still be downloaded through [here](https://launchpad.net/madanalysis5) until the 
release of `v2.0`. Note that future versions will only be available through GitHub. 

If you satisfy the requirements mentioned [above](#requirements) the only thing that you need to do is
clone or download this repository and start playing;
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MadAnalysis/madanalysis5.git # or choose download zip option 
$ cd madanalysis5
$ ./bin/ma5
```

### Very first steps with MadAnalysis 5

To start MadAnalysis 5, it is enough to type in a shell `./bin/ma5`

In a first step, the program checks all the dependencies and provide warning
and/or error messages if necessary. Next, the `SampleAnalyzer` C++ kernel library
is generated. This is performed once and for all at the first run of MadAnalysis 
- Let us however note that if the system configuration changes, this is
detected by MadAnalysis 5 and the library is regenerated.

If everything is going as smoothly as it should, a Python command line interface
with a `ma5>` prompt appears. To learn how to use MadAnalysis 5 and to get an
overview of its functionalities, we refer in particular to Section 3 of the
manual that can be found [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1599).

### Troubleshootings and bug reports

Any public release of MadAnalysis 5 has been automatically and intensely
validated. However, especially due to the variety of possible system
configurations and the large number of functionalities included in the program,
it is not impossible that some bugs are found. In this case, is is strongly
suggested to create a report on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/MadAnalysis/madanalysis5/issues).

In this way, you also participate to the improvement of MadAnalysis 5 and the
authors thank you for this.

### Our famous last words

The development team of MadAnalysis 5 hopes that the package will meet the
expectations of the users and help particle physicists in their phenomenological
investigations.

That's all folks!
