### Before submitting

Please complete the following checklist when submitting a PR:
  - [ ] All new features must include a test sequence.
      If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add a 
      test sequence below for it to be checked by other developers.
  - [ ] All new functions and code must be clearly commented and documented.
      If you do make documentation changes, make sure that the docs build and
      render correctly by running `./doc/makedoc`.
  - [ ] Add a new entry to the `madanalysis/UpdateNotes.txt` file, summarizing the
      change, and including a link back to the PR.
  
When all the above are checked, delete everything above the dashed
line and fill in the pull request template.
