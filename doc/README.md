# MadAnalysis 5 Brief Documentation

This file includes brief reference cards for the so-called normal and expert
modes of MadAnalysis5. To compile these cards, it is sufficient to type
  `$ ./makedoc`
in a shell. This generates two files named `normal_mode.pdf` and
`expert_mode.pdf` in the present folder.

For a more detailed documentation we refer to our list of publications
referenced [here](https://github.com/MadAnalysis/madanalysis5#credits).
